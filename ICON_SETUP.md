```bash
<https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined&icon_names=app_registration,home,menu,login,logout,dashboard,business_center,info&display=block rel='stylesheet' />
```

*Important: Ensure the CSS request includes **&display=block** to prevent a flash of unstyled text content (FOUC) showing the ligatures until the font loads.*
