# Project About

- project name
- project timeline
- company name
- project outcome
- who worked on it
- any important lessons
- who the project was for
- what you did specifically
- who cared about the project
- project budget (ballpark is fine)
- any challenges you can think of
- any mistakes or failures you can think of

After you've jogged your memory, reorganize the information into your STAR story. Notice I add a lesson and application as well.

• Situation: the problem you're solving for
• Task: what you were responsible for
• Action: three key actions you did
• Results: quantified (preferred) or qualified
• Lesson: what you learned
• Application: how you will apply your lesson later

Practice delivering your story in front of a mirror or with a friend. Record the audio so you can critique yourself.

Your STAR should take about 3 minutes. Your lesson and application should take about 2 minutes.

Check in with your interviewer before you launch into your lesson. It gives your story an organic break.
