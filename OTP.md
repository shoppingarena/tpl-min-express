# One Time Password OTP

 I asked ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Copilot Microsoft, Gemini 2.0 Flash t3.chat

Prompt:

'I need to implement OTP one time password. I have already JWT authentication with refresh token implemented. I have nodemailer working.
Act as highly educated engineer. Explain and recommend best open source industry npm library, browser API for OTP if exist to implement OTP for my application which is node.js and express.js backend service with pug template engine.'

## Recommended Open-Source NPM Libraries by chatgpt

a) otplib (**Best Choice**)

- Why? otplib (One-Time Password Library) is a well-maintained and battle-tested library for generating and validating OTPs using both Time-based (TOTP) and HMAC-based (HOTP) algorithms.
- Industry Standard: Implements RFC 4226 (HOTP) and RFC 6238 (TOTP).
- Flexible: Can be used with SMS, Email (via Nodemailer), or an authentication app (Google Authenticator).

b) speakeasy (Alternative)

- Similar to otplib, speakeasy is a popular library that provides TOTP and HOTP implementation.

### Second prompt 'What NPM library is best choice for passkey implementation': by chatgpt

c) @simplewebauthn/server for later implementation of **Passkey**

**Why?**
It is a well-maintained, industry-standard library for handling FIDO2/WebAuthn authentication on the server side.

Supports:

- Passwordless authentication using Passkeys
- Device-bound credentials (e.g., Face ID, Touch ID, YubiKey)
- User verification with biometric or security keys
- Compliant with WebAuthn standards (used by Google, Apple, and Microsoft for Passkeys).

d) fide2-lib

- Lower-level library for implementing FIDO2/WebAuthn.
- Requires more manual setup compared to @simplewebauthn/server.

## Understanding the OTP Landscape by Gemini 2.0 Flash t3.chat

OTP adds a crucial layer of security, especially when dealing with sensitive user data. There are two primary types of OTP:

1. Time-Based OTP (TOTP): These OTPs change at regular intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds). They are generated using a shared secret key and the current time.
2. SMS-Based OTP: These OTPs are sent to the user's mobile phone via SMS.

## Implementation steps by Gemini 2.0 Flash t3.chat

1. User Initiates OTP Request:

    - The user clicks a button or takes an action that triggers the OTP flow (e.g., during login or when enabling two-factor authentication).

2. Server Generates Secret and OTP:

    - Generate a unique secret for the user using otplib.
    - Store the secret securely in the user's record in your database (encrypt it if possible).
    - Generate the OTP using otplib and the secret.

3. Server Sends OTP via Email:

    - Use Nodemailer to send an email to the user containing the OTP. Include a clear message about the OTP's expiration time.

4. User Enters OTP:

    - The user enters the OTP they received in the email into the input field on your website.

5. Server Verifies OTP:

    - Retrieve the secret from the database for the user.
    - Use otplib to verify the OTP entered by the user against the stored secret.
    - If the OTP is valid, proceed with the authentication or action. If it's invalid, display an error message.

### Security Considerations by Gemini 2.0 Flash t3.chat

- Secret Key Protection: The secret key is the most critical piece of information. Store it securely in your database. Consider encryption at rest.
- Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the OTP verification endpoint.
- OTP Expiration: Set a short expiration time for OTPs (e.g., 30-60 seconds).
- Email Security: Use a reputable email service provider and configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to prevent email spoofing.
- HTTPS: Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server.
- Input Validation: Sanitize and validate user input to prevent injection attacks.
- Consider using a library like bcrypt to hash the secret key before storing it in the database.

### Additional Tips by Gemini 2.0 Flash t3.chat

- User Experience: Provide clear instructions to the user on how to use the OTP.
- Resend OTP: Allow users to request a new OTP if they don't receive the first one.
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): OTP is often used as part of a 2FA system. Consider implementing a more comprehensive - 2FA solution if you require a higher level of security.
- Consider using a dedicated SMS provider (Twilio, Vonage) for SMS-based OTP if email delivery is unreliable.

## Database by Gemini 2.0 Flash t3.chat

You need to store the secret key and associate it with the user. Add a column to your user table called otp_secret.

## Browser API by perplexity

 For browser-side OTP input, you can use the input type="number" HTML element with appropriate attributes like maxlength="6" for a 6-digit OTP. There's no specific browser API for OTP, but you can enhance user experience with JavaScript:

 ```js
 input(type="number" maxlength="6" pattern="[0-9]*" inputmode="numeric" autocomplete="one-time-code")

 ```

## There is a notable browser API called the Web OTP API by copilot microsoft

Web OTP API

- Overview: The Web OTP API, currently available in some modern browsers (notably Chrome on Android), allows web applications to programmatically retrieve OTP codes sent via SMS. It enhances user experience by auto-filling the OTP into web forms on mobile devices.

Usage Consideration:

- Limited Support: This API isnâ€™t universally supported across all browsers or operating systems.

- Security & Permissions: It requires user permission, and be sure to follow the guidelines for security to prevent abuse.

- Flow: The API listens for an SMS arriving with a particular format. The SMS must be formatted in a way that the browser recognizes (usually including a domain-bound one-time code).

### Use Browser API by Gemini 2.0 Flash t3.chat

- User Interaction
- Clipboard Access

Steps:

otpRouter.mjs
otp.mjs (createOtpTable, inserOtpData, createOtpSecret)

1. - [X] Install otplib
2. - [X] [Create Table otp_tbl](./otp.mjs)
3. - [ ] Create User Settings to enable OTP
4. - [ ] Insert Credentials into otp_table
