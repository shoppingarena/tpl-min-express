# OFFLINE AUTHENTICATION FOR PWA

**Prompt:**
'I am building PWA application which is working offline. I need to solve for premium users authentication and authorization offline. What is by research studies and most used solution. I use node.js and express.js as backend server.'

For offline authentication and authorization of premium users in your PWA, the most researched and commonly used solutions involve JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with local storage, OAuth2 with Proof of Possession (PoP) tokens, and cryptographic offline verification. Hereâ€™s how you can approach it:

## 1. JWT with Offline Validation (Most Common)

When the user logs in online, issue a JWT with user claims (role, permissions, etc.).
Store the JWT in IndexedDB (safer than localStorage).
When offline, verify the JWT locally using a pre-fetched public key from your server.
This allows authorization without needing to contact the backend.

Pros:
Industry standard, fast, easy to implement.
Works with role-based access control (RBAC).
Can be refreshed when online.

Cons:
Token expiration may cause access issues if the user remains offline too long.
No real-time permission updates unless refreshed online.

## 2. OAuth2 with PoP Tokens (More Secure)

Instead of a simple JWT, issue a Proof of Possession (PoP) token that contains user authentication details.
PoP tokens require a private key stored securely in IndexedDB.
Even if stolen, the attacker cannot use the token without the private key.

Pros:
Stronger security than regular JWTs.
Can prevent token theft and replay attacks.

Cons:
More complex implementation.
Requires cryptographic key handling in the browser.

## 3. Public-Key Cryptography with Local Verification

When online, the user gets a signed token containing access permissions.
Store a public key in the app and use it to verify the token when offline.
Can use WebAuthn (Passkeys) for passwordless authentication.

Pros:
Very secure, no reliance on server availability.
Works well with passkey-based authentication.

Cons:
Requires cryptographic operations in the browser.
Key management complexity.
